# Sound-Space-Multi-Tool

This repository is currently just for holding the changelog for the largely work-in-progress Sound Space Multi Tool.

This program contains many converters and miscellaneous other tools for automating tasks such as randomizing or speeding up maps or turning Clone Hero timing points into OSU timing points.

It will be fully released here once everything is confirmed to be working.

Any newly uploaded files are to be considered open for beta testing and may not always work as intended.

Please report any bugs you may come across if you do decide to download this tool for yourself.
